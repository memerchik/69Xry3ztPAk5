This paper analyzes the formation of a transnational public sphere in China through the joint empirical study of two key institutions – a transnational organization (the Rotary Club) and the Shanghai periodical press, which has been recognized as the first mass medium for disseminating information in modern China. Methodologically, we rely on structural topic modeling (STM) to harness large corpora of digitized newspapers from a bilingual (Chinese/English) and dynamic perspective. We show that STM has the potential to encompass both the discursive and social aspects of the public sphere and to bridge the gap between previous theoretical and empirical studies. Thanks to STM, we are able to precisely classify and quantify the four main domains of the public sphere (meeting, self-organization, forum, community service) and to model their local and global dimensions. Furthermore, we reveal significant convergences between languages and a growing awareness of global issues during the troubled decades of the Republic (1919-1949). Methodologically, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we offer a simple yet efficient solution, based on concordance, to the problem of article segmentation in digitized newspapers. Second, this paper constitutes a rare instance of cross-lingual comparison involving a low-resource language, namely, the Chinese language during its transitional stage between classical and modern Chinese. Third, we demonstrate the value of using a multi-model approach to navigate between different levels of granularity, especially when dealing with corpora of different sizes and structures.
